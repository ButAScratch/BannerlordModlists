## Installation

### Quick foreword

[via this method]: https://redd.it/g0korl

While the Bannerlord Mod Launcher should do it for you, always make sure your mod's DLLs are unblocked [via this method] if you are crashing on startup.
To save any headaches, I recommend starting the game and loading into the character customization screen (Where you would select your character's culture) every 10 mods or so just to make sure things are being nice. Doing this also makes setting up the load order easy because you'd be doing it gradually.

Also, if you don't like a mod you can remove it as long as nothing else in the list is relying on it. To check this go to the mod that you want to remove's page, and click the `Requirements` dropdown if it exists. If it doesn't exist, you're safe to remove it. If it does, check if anything in the `Mods requiring this file` section is in the mod list. If no mods in the list require the mod to function, you're safe to remove it.

Generally speaking, other mods can also be added into the list seamlessly as long as they're not touching the same files, like having two mods that change the Sturgian troop tree, or several mods that change the world's layout for example.

### Now on to the instructions!
**Method One** *(Recommended if you don't feel like overcomplicating things)*

[Bannerlord Mod Launcher]: https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/265


- Download the [Bannerlord Mod Launcher]. Extract it to your game's directory.
- Download the correct version of each mod manually.
- Extract mod contents to `...\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules`. 

(This looks something like `...\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\Diplomacy\SubModule.xml`).

- Start BML and set the load order as the list the mods are in on the mod list page. 

- Once you're in the game, head to the Mod Options menu and change the settings to your preference.

- Profit.

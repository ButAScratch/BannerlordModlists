## Installation

[Bannerlord Mod Launcher]: https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/265
- Download & install the [Bannerlord Mod Launcher].
- Download the correct version of each mod manually. Every 10 or so you should follow the below step & run the game to make sure things are still being nice.
- Extract mod contents to `...\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules`. 

(This looks something like `...\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\Diplomacy`)

- Start BML and set the load order as the list the mods are in on the modlist page.

- Profit.

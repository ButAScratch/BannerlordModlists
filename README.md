## Installation

### Quick foreword

While the Bannerlord Mod Launcher should do it for you, always check to see if a mod's DLLs are not being unblocked if you are crashing.
To save any headaches, I recommend following steps 3 and four every 10 or so mods just to make sure things are still being nice.

[Bannerlord Mod Launcher]: https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/265
1. Download & install the [Bannerlord Mod Launcher].
2. Download the correct version of each mod manually.
3. Extract mod contents to `...\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules`. 

(This looks something like `...\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\Diplomacy`)

4. Start BML and set the load order as the list the mods are in on the modlist page.

5. Once you're in the game, head to the Mod Options menu and change the settings to your preference.

6. Profit.

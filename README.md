## Installation

### Quick foreword

While the Bannerlord Mod Launcher should do it for you, always check to see if a mod's DLLs are not being unblocked if you are crashing on startup.
To save any headaches, I recommend starting the game and loading into the character customization screen (Where you would select your character's culture) every 10 mods or so just to make sure things are being nice.

Also, if you don't like a mod you can remove it as long as nothing else in the list is relying on it. To check this go to the mod that you want to remove's page, and click the `Requirements` dropdown if it exists. If it doesn't exist, you're safe to remove it. If it does, check if anything in the `Mods requiring this file` section is in the mod list. If no mods in the list require the mod to function, you're safe to remove it.

Generally speaking, other mods can also be added into the list seamlessly as long as they're not touching the same files, like having two mods that change the Sturgian troop tree, for example.  


Now on to the instructions!

[Bannerlord Mod Launcher]: https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/265
1. Download & install the [Bannerlord Mod Launcher].
2. Download the correct version of each mod manually.
3. Extract mod contents to `...\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules`. 

(This looks something like `...\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\Diplomacy\bin`. Not every mod will have a bin folder but you get the point.)

4. Start BML and set the load order as the list the mods are in on the modlist page.

5. Once you're in the game, head to the Mod Options menu and change the settings to your preference.

6. Profit.
